# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Description

This project delves into the realm of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. It covers various tasks centered around writing test cases before code implementation, a crucial aspect of software development methodology.


## Concepts Covered

- **Never forget a test:** Focuses on the importance of writing comprehensive test cases.

## Background Context

An important notice regarding intranet checks for Python projects has been issued, emphasizing the significance of focusing on TDD principles and exploring all potential cases before coding.

## Resources

Essential resources to review for this project include:
- `doctest` in Python
- `Unit Tests in Python`
- `Unittest` module
- Interactive and Non-interactive tests

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, the main learning objectives are:
- Understand why Python programming is advantageous
- Grasp the concept of an interactive test
- Recognize the importance of writing tests
- Master the technique of writing Docstrings for test creation
- Learn how to document modules and functions
- Understand the fundamental option flags for creating tests
- Develop the skill to identify edge cases

## Copyright - Plagiarism

The completion of tasks must be original and meet the learning objectives specified. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpretation/Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **Coding Norms:** pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **Execution:** All files must be executable
- **File Requirements:** Ending with a new line and starting with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Mandatory File:** A README.md file at the root of the project directory

### Python Test Cases

- **File Format:** Text files (.txt) within the 'tests' directory
- **Test Execution:** `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- **Module & Function Documentation:** Essential and strictly validated
- **Recommendation:** Collaboration to cover all edge cases is highly encouraged

## Tasks

This project comprises tasks focused on several Python functions with defined criteria and test cases. Here are a few exemplar tasks:

- **0. Integers addition:** Create a function that adds 2 integers.
- **1. Divide a matrix:** Function to divide all elements of a matrix.
- **2. Say my name:** Print a specific string that includes first and last names.
- **3. Print square:** Generate a square pattern using the `#` character.
- **4. Text indentation:** Function to format a text with new lines.
- **5. Max integer - Unittest:** Addition of Unittests for a given function.
