# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Overview
This project revolves around the implementation of classes and objects in Python, focusing on the creation and manipulation of Rectangle objects. It involves building a Rectangle class and defining methods to manage its attributes and behaviors.

## File Descriptions
* `0-rectangle.py` - Defines an empty class Rectangle.
* `1-rectangle.py` - Implements the Rectangle class with private attributes, width, and height.
* `2-rectangle.py` - Enhances the Rectangle class with methods to calculate area and perimeter.
* `3-rectangle.py` - Further extends the Rectangle class with string representation methods.
* `4-rectangle.py` - Implements repr() to enable instance recreation using eval().
* `5-rectangle.py` - Adds functionality to detect instance deletion.
* `6-rectangle.py` - Enhances the Rectangle class with a count of instances created and deleted.
* `7-rectangle.py` - Enhances the Rectangle class with customizable symbols for string representation.
* `8-rectangle.py` - Introduces a method to compare rectangles based on area.
* `9-rectangle.py` - Introduces a square method to create a square instance.

## Project Tasks
Each file corresponds to a specific task and aims to fulfill the requirements specified.

## How to Use
To test each file, execute the corresponding `main` file. For instance, to test task 0, run `./0-main.py`.

## Learning Objectives
* Gain a deeper understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
* Learn about class attributes, instance attributes, and their manipulation.
* Understand the usage of properties, methods, and string representations for objects.
* Learn to compare and manage instances and their lifecycles.

## Requirements
* Files are written and tested in Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
* All files end with a new line.
* The first line of each file contains `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
* Code adheres to PEP8 style (checked using `pycodestyle`).
* All files are executable.
* Utilize a `README.md` to describe the project detail.
