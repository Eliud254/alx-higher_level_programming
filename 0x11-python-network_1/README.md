# Python - Network #1

## Overview
Welcome to the Python Network #1 project! In this module, you'll explore network programming using Python, focusing on fetching internet resources, handling HTTP requests, and utilizing the `urllib` and `requests` packages. Guided by Guillaume, the CTO at Holberton School, you'll enhance your skills in making HTTP requests and manipulating data from external services.

## Resources
Make sure to go through the following resources:
- [HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib Package](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html)
- [Quickstart with Requests package](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/)
- [Requests package](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you'll be adept at:
- Fetching internet resources with the `urllib` Python package
- Decoding `urllib` body responses
- Utilizing the Python package `requests`
- Making HTTP GET requests
- Making HTTP POST/PUT/etc. requests
- Fetching JSON resources
- Manipulating data from external services
## Requirements
Ensure your code meets the following criteria:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpretation/compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root and within the project folder is mandatory
- Code should adhere to `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- Document modules (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- Use `get` to access dictionary values by key
- Ensure documentation provides clear sentences about the purpose of modules, classes, or methods
- Code should not execute when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
