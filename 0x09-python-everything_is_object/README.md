Weight: 1
Ongoing second chance project - started Oct 31, 2023 6:00 AM, must end by Nov 2, 2023 6:00 AM
An auto review will be launched at the deadline

Background Context
Exploring the concept that everything in Python is an object and delving deeper into how Python works with various types of objects.

Are you familiar with unexpected variable modifications? For example:

>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
>>> 

Or what happens here?

>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> m = l
>>> l[0] = 'x'
>>> m
['x', 2, 3]
>>> 

This project differs from typical projects. The initial part is based on questions about Python's specificities like predicting results. Read the documentation thoroughly and contemplate with peers before coding to enhance understanding without relying solely on the Python interpreter.

An essential understanding of why the answers to these tasks are what they are, empowers applying the same logic to diverse variable types and situations. Mastery over these types of questions is vital for Python interviews.

Resources
Read or watch:

- 9.10. Objects and values
- 9.11. Aliasing
- Immutable vs mutable types
- Mutation (Only this chapter)
- 9.12. Cloning lists
- Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing

Learning Objectives
Upon project completion, one should independently explain:

- Python's greatness
- What defines an object
- Difference between class and an object or instance
- Immutable vs. mutable objects
- What is a reference
- Assignment's significance
- Alias's role
- Identifying identical variables
- Linking variables to the same object
- Displaying the variable identifier (the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- Understanding mutability and immutability
- Recognition of built-in mutable and immutable types
- Python's variable-passing mechanism
