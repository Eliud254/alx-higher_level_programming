# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

## Overview
This project focuses on JavaScript programming, specifically covering Objects, Scopes, and Closures. The goal is to enhance your understanding of JavaScript's object-oriented features, scope, and closure concepts.

### Resources
For a comprehensive understanding of the concepts covered in this project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:
- [JavaScript object basics](#)
- [Object-oriented JavaScript (read all examples!)](#)
- [Class - ES6](#)
- [super - ES6](#)
- [extends - ES6](#)
- [Object prototypes](#)
- [Inheritance in JavaScript](#)
- [Closures](#)
- [this/self](#)
- [Modern JS](#)

### Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following without assistance:
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to create an object in JavaScript
- The meaning of `this` in JavaScript
- The significance of `undefined`
- Why variable type and scope are important
- What a closure is
- What a prototype is
- How to inherit an object from another

### Requirements
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x)
- **File Ending:** All files should end with a new line
- **File Start:** The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- **README.md:** A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code Style:** Code should be semistandard compliant (Rules of Standard + semicolons on top). Also, reference AirBnB style
- **Executable Files:** All files must be executable
- **Line Length:** The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- **Prohibited:** The use of `var` is not allowed

### Installation Guide
To run and interpret the code, ensure Node.js version 14 is installed. You can follow the instructions below to install Node.js 14 and `semistandard`:
```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

### Project Structure
- **[Files]:** List all files relevant to the project
- **[Directories]:** Describe any important directories in the project

### Conclusion
