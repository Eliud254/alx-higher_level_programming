## Project Overview

This project focuses on Python Input/Output tasks. It involves handling file operations, serialization and deserialization using JSON, and creating a Pascal's triangle.

The project aims to cover the following objectives:

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the importance of Python programming for file Input/Output operations.
- Perform file handling tasks such as reading, writing, and appending to text files.
- Work with JSON data, performing serialization and deserialization.
- Implement solutions to accomplish tasks using Python without importing any modules.

### Project Structure
- The project is divided into various tasks, each addressing specific Input/Output functionalities.
- Requirements are outlined for Python scripts, test cases, and the implementation of specific functionalities for each task.

### Project Structure:
- The project directory consists of subdirectories for each task, with associated Python script files for implementation.
- Test files and associated usage examples are also included in separate directories.
- Each task is accompanied by usage examples to showcase the expected functionality of the implemented Python scripts.

## Project Tasks

The project encompasses several tasks to address specific Input/Output functionalities. Each task is designed to achieve a specific goal while adhering to coding standards and Python best practices.

### Task List:
1. **Read File**
   - Implement a function to read a text file and print its content.

2. **Write to a File**
   - Write a function that writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written.

3. **Append to a File**
   - Develop a function to append a string to the end of a text file and return the number of characters added.

4. **To JSON String**
   - Create a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).

5. **From JSON String to Object**
   - Develop a function to convert a JSON string into a Python data structure.

6. **Save Object to a File**
   - Implement a function to save an object to a text file using JSON representation.

7. **Create Object from a JSON File**
   - Write a function that creates an object from a JSON file.

8. **Load, Add, Save**
   - Create a script that adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file using JSON representation.

9. **Class to JSON**
   - Write a function to get the dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object.

10. **Student to JSON with Filter**
    - Develop a class that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance with optional attribute filtering.

11. **Student to Disk and Reload**
    - Design a class that saves and reloads attributes of a Student instance from a file using JSON representation.

12. **Pascal's Triangle**
    - Create a function that returns Pascal's Triangle as a list of lists of integers.

### Usage
- Each task includes example usage to demonstrate the functionality of the implemented Python scripts.
- Examples showcase expected input and output for better understanding and testing.
