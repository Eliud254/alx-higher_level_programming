## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to provide examples of exception handling in Python. It consists of several functions, each designed to showcase how to handle different types of exceptions. This project is intended for educational purposes and helps users understand how to work with exceptions effectively in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style checking

## Usage

To use this project, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x05-python-exceptions.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd 0x05-python-exceptions
```

3. Execute the Python files to run the provided functions and see the exception handling in action.

4. You can run each Python file individually or use the provided test scripts in the `main.py` files.

## Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each showcasing a specific aspect of exception handling in Python:

1. **Safe list printing**: A function to print a specified number of elements from a list, demonstrating the use of `try` and `except` for handling exceptions.

2. **Safe printing of an integers list**: A function to print integers with formatting, showing how to handle non-integer values gracefully.

3. **Integers division with debug**: A function to divide two integers and print the result while handling division by zero exceptions.

4. **Divide a list**: A function to divide elements from two lists and handle various types of exceptions gracefully, including division by zero and type errors.

5. **Raise exception**: A function to raise a custom type exception.

6. **Raise a message**: A function to raise a custom type exception with a user-provided message.

Each task demonstrates different exception-handling scenarios.
