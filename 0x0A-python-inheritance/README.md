### Learning Objectives

At the completion of this project, you'll be able to explain the following concepts:

- Why Python programming is incredible
- Understanding superclass, base class, or parent class
- Defining subclasses and their usage
- Listing all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- Understanding when an instance can have new attributes
- Implementing class inheritance in Python, including multiple base classes
- Recognizing the default class every class inherits from
- Overriding a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Identifying attributes or methods available by inheritance to subclasses
- Grasping the purpose and significance of inheritance
- Mastering the usage of `isinstance()`, `issubclass()`, `type()`, and `super()` built-in functions

#### Copyright & Plagiarism

Please adhere to the following:

- Craft your solutions to meet the specified learning objectives.
- Avoid copying or directly using someone else's work.
- Do not publish any content related to this project.
- Plagiarism is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program.

### Requirements

#### Python Scripts
- **Editors:** Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Ensure all your files end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files must be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) in your code.
- All files must be executable.
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`.

#### Python Test Cases
- Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs.
- All test files should be text files with a `.txt` extension and stored in the `tests` folder.
- Execute all test files using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- Ensure all modules, classes, and functions have proper documentation.
- Documentation should be informative and descriptive, providing the purpose of the module, class, or method.
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover various edge cases.
- Do not use the words `import` or `from` inside comments.

#### Quiz Questions

To verify your progress, you will be presented with quiz questions. Keep moving forward!
