# Project README: ALX - Higher-Level Programming

## Welcome to the ALX Higher-Level Programming Repository

**Note: This README is designed to provide an overview of the project and its structure.**

### Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and C programs designed to help you learn the basics of programming, particularly in Python and C. These scripts cover a wide range of topics, including control flow, loops, functions, and more.

### Python Scripts

#### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This script assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

#### 1. The last digit
This script assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints the last digit of that number, along with whether it's greater than 5, less than 6 and not 0, or exactly 0.

#### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
This script prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, with the characters not separated by a new line.

#### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
This script prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', with the characters not separated by a new line.

#### 4. Hexadecimal printing
This script prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal format, displaying them side by side.

#### 5. 00...99
This script prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by commas and spaces, with each number displayed as two digits.

#### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
This script prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by commas and spaces, in ascending order.

#### 7. islower
This script defines a function `islower(c)` that checks if a character is lowercase. It returns `True` if the character is lowercase and `False` otherwise.

#### 8. To uppercase
This script defines a function `uppercase(str)` that prints a given string in uppercase followed by a new line.

#### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
This script defines a function `print_last_digit(number)` that prints the last digit of a number and returns its value.

#### 10. a + b
This script defines a function `add(a, b)` that adds two integers and returns the result.

#### 11. a ^ b
This script defines a function `pow(a, b)` that computes `a` to the power of `

b` and returns the result.

#### 12. Fizz Buzz
This script prints numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz."

#### 13. Insert in sorted linked list
This script defines a function `insert_node(head, data)` that inserts a node with a given data value into a sorted linked list.

#### 14. Smile in the mirror
This script prints a smiley face using only the characters `:`, `-`, and `)`.

#### 15. Remove at position
This script defines a function `delete_at(head, index)` that deletes a node at a specific position in a linked list.

#### 16. ByteCode -> Python #2
This script prints the Python bytecode of a given Python function.

### Usage

To run any of the Python scripts, simply execute them using a Python interpreter. For example:

```bash
python 0-positive_or_negative.py
